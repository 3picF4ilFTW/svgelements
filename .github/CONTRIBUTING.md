# Contributing

@Tatarize welcomes contributions to this repository from users of MeerK40t.
These can be code improvements or language translations made as [Pull Requests](/meerk40t/svgelements/pulls),
constructive suggestions or bug reports made using [Issues](/meerk40t/svgelements/issues),
or comments against other people's Pull Requests or Issues.

3. Because svgelements is a package used by several other pieces of software,
your changes need to be backwardly compatible with previous versions.
If the change you want to make is not going to be backwardly compatible,
or if your thoughts are not firmed up enough to make a formal submission,
please discuss this with @tatarize using one of the following online discussion links:
* [IRC](http://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.libera.chat/meerk40t)
* [Discord](https://discord.gg/qvASRhFZGB)

Please note we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Requests

Code improvements and language improvements need to be submitted as Pull Requests.
Usually you will need to:

1. On Github, fork the
[MeerK40t/SvgElements repo](/meerk40t/svgelements),
2. Use Git to clone your fork to your computer
3. Create a new Git branch for your changes
4. Code and test your changes
5. Use Git to push them up to Github; and
6. Create a Github Push Request.

If you are not a Git expert (and how many of us are?),
you may want to install Github Desktop to make this easy for you.

When you are submitting a Pull Request:

1. Please feel free to submit incomplete changes if you want early feedback.
Please mark such submissions as **Draft** until they are ready for formal review.
2. Where appropriate add new Unit Tests.
Please ensure that both existing and new Unit Tests run cleanly when you have finished coding.
